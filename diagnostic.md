# Ember Routing Diagnostic

Record your responses inside the fenced code blocks below each question.

1.  What are the main task(s) you perform inside the Ember Application Router,
    and what are the main task(s) you perform inside an Ember Route?

    ```md
    Inside the router you tell ember where to look for data and templates for a given URL.

    In an ember route you define the models for the data, so this is where you will either have static data stored, or query your database for data.
    ```

1.  What is the command to generate a route named `boston` nested under
    `campus`?

    ```md
    ember g route campus/boston
    ```

1.  Suppose you have a nested route at the URL `/campus/boston`. How would you
    use the `link-to` helper to generate an appropriate link?

    ```md
    {{#link-to 'campus.boston'}}Boston Campus{{/link-to}}
    ```

1.  Explain **at least** two differences between the following two route
    definitions.

    ```js
    this.route('products', function () {
      this.route('product', { path: '/:product_id' }); // <= ðŸ‘€here
    });

    this.route('product', { path: '/products/:product_id' }); // <= ðŸ‘€ here
    ```

    ```md
    The top one, the URL for a given product would be: 'products/product/product_id'

    Where the bottom one would be:
    'products/product_id'

    Also, with the top example ember would look inside the 'products' directory for a folder called 'product' for its data. The bottom it would look in the app directory for the directory 'product.
    ```

1.  Suppose we have the following route definition:

    ```js
    this.route('movie', { path: '/movies/:movie_id' }); // <= ðŸ‘€ here
    ```

    If we navigate in the browser to `/movies/123`, how can we reference the
    value `'123'` inside a Route?

    ```md
    params.movie_id
    ```

1.  Inside a template, how do we reference data provided by a Route?

    ```md
    The data passed from the Route is called by 'model'. So if the data had an attribute name you would call it by model.name.
    ```
